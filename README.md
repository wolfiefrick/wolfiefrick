Hello, world! My name is Wolfgang Frick, and I'm a self-taught graphic designer and web developer. I work on mainly frivolous pursuits in the development world, like small games.

I'm heavily invested into the Apple ecosystem, and would like to start learning about how to develop for macOS, iOS, and watchOS. I'm in high school, so, of course, I've not much time to dedicate to said pursuits, but I'm planning to kick my development mind into high gear during the summer of 2017, before my sophomore year.
